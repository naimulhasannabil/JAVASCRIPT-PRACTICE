// Basic Practices
var num = 10;
var num = 15;
console.log(num); // Variables are changeable and can be modified

let num1 = 10;
num1 = 20; // let are changeable and can be modified but when modifying the code don't add let keywords
console.log(num1);

const num2 = 10;
console.log(num2); // const are not changeable and can't be modified
